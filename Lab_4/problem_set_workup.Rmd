This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```
5. Import our data
```{r}
DATA <- read.csv("DaRTS_combined_data.csv")
```


```{r}

fdf <- DATA %>% filter(Salinity_PSU > 20)

sdlm <- lm(fdf$Salinity_PSU ~ fdf$Density)

lmslope <- sdlm$coefficients[2]
lmintercept <- sdlm$coefficients[1]

# adding the line to our plot
ggplot(data = fdf) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Density, y = Salinity_PSU)) +
  geom_abline(slope=lmslope,intercept=lmintercept, size=2, color = "darkblue")
  #xlab('Temperature (deg C)') +
  #ylab('Fluorescence (mg/m^3)')
```
```{r}
lfdf <- fdf %>% mutate(log_sal = log10(Salinity_PSU)) %>% filter(is.finite(log_sal))

log
